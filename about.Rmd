#### About 

This web application uses a linear mixed effects predictive model based on the Framingham Offspring Study to predict lung function decline over time in healthy adult population. Predictions are based on twenty common predictors selected through machine learning selection, and random effects to model unexplained heterogeneity among individuals. 

The full model which includes all the predictors is externally validated it in two large, multi-center cohorts. The web app is adaptive to the user input; when all inputs are not available, the app fits a reduced model to the data and uses that for prediction. It must be emphasized that reduced models are, by definition, less accurate than the full model. 

Please refer to the manuscript for more details on the structure of the model and the validation process.
